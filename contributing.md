Your PR/MRs must be created between October 1 and October 31 (in any time zone, UTC-12 thru UTC+14).

Your PR/MRs must be made to a public, unarchived repository.

Pull/merge requests created before October 1 but merged or marked as ready for review after do not count.

PR/MRs that are labeled with a label containing the word “spam” by maintainers will not be counted.


We use the Node.js RegEx engine with /\bspam\b/i to look for spam labels.

PR/MRs that also have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label cannot be marked as spammy via a label.

PR/MRs that have been merged and do not have a label containing the word “invalid” cannot be marked as spammy via a label.
 

PR/MRs that our system detects as spammy will also not be counted.

Any user with two or more spammy PR/MRs will be disqualified.

Hacktoberfest is now opt-in for maintainers, so only contribute to projects that indicate they’re looking for Hacktoberfest PR/MRs.

Once your PR/MR has passed this check, we won’t check this again (unless your PR/MR fails a check before this, such as it being marked as spammy).

Your PR/MR must match criteria to be considered participating before Hacktoberfest ends on October 31 (in any time zone, UTC-12 thru UTC+14) to be counted.

PR/MRs that have a label containing the word “invalid” won’t be counted, unless they also have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label.

Specifically, we use the Node.js RegEx engine with /\binvalid\b/i to look for invalid labels.

Your PR/MR must not be a draft to be considered accepted.

If your PR/MR is being accepted for Hacktoberfest via an overall approving review it must also not be closed.

Your PR/MR must be accepted by a maintainer before Hacktoberfest ends on October 31 (in any time zone, UTC-12 thru UTC+14) to be counted.

We continually evaluate all of the checks until your PR/MR completes the seven-day review period, except the [participating] check which is a one-time check. If it fails any of these checks during this time, the seven day timer will reset.

After the seven day review period completes, your PR/MR will be automatically accepted for Hacktoberfest assuming it still passes all the checks. Once accepted for Hacktoberfest, we stop checking. :party:

PR/MRs that are passing all checks and are still in the review period on October 31 can continue the seven-day review period into November.
